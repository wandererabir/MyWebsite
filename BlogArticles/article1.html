    <h1>" HOW TO LEARN FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT EASILY "</h1>
    <p>I will just say,<strong>” DO IT !! ”</strong>. It’s only been 6 months since I started learning about web development. At first, it was a horrible road to go down. But, I found a shortcut, you still have to work hard and practice a lot. Let me tell you the secret.</p>
    <p>I already knew the basics of HTML except I didn’t know anything about CSS or JavaScript. I started my journey by rushing into the intermediate level of website building. I opened my laptop, went to YouTube, and typed, <strong>“Netflix Clone Using HTML CSS”</strong> is a movie and series addict. I opened the first video that came and made some popcorn and sat down. I watched the three hours long video overnight(with my helping buddy - <strong>COFFEE</strong>) and I am proud of myself because it was not <strong>“ Zack Snyder’s Justice League “</strong>. I also downloaded the whole code from the creator’s GitHub(take as much advantage as you get). From that video, I learned the basis of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how things work, and a few of the advanced techniques that went over my head.</p>
    <p>Now, the main part of secret is that you have to do experiments. Earlier I said that I downloaded the code of Netflix Clone and I utilized it fully. It did experiments on it and learned things through it. It’s all about playing around with the UI components of the website. The more you experiment, the more you will learn the inner working of it. I did this for 15-20 days straight, I turned <strong>Netflix Clone into Travel Website then into a Portfolio Website</strong> . It was fun to screw around with some else work and turning it into something new.</p>
    <p>Then, I found the real treasure, should I tell you what is it? Just kidding, I am going to tell you. Actually, there are two - <strong>1. CodePen 2. Stack Overflow</strong>, these two will help you to understand basic and small things such as did you get stuck somewhere, Stack Overflow will have answers and some explanations. You want to do something new and innovative, CodePen is there for you. Then again, experiments and read and learn, this is the only cycle you need to ace your understanding of basics and intermediate level of front-end development.</p>
    <p>The final part of secret is that <strong>“ NEVER EVER COPY & PASTE “</strong>, it doesn’t make you a thief maybe but it definitely makes you a fool. If you are just copying and pasting it, then you are at loss. First of all, you are not learning anything at all and secondly, if anyone asks you to make them understand what you did, you will become a fool at that point in time. If it’s going to take a lot of time to understand, then give it that time. There are no shortcuts to success, it’s someone else quotes by the way. If something is not getting into that skull of yours, then try again and again. But never give up on it, the moment you give in, you give up the aim of becoming a good, maybe <strong>awesome developer.</strong> </p>
    <p>I am not teaching you the basis or anything, I am just guiding you on how to accomplish them. By the way, since then, I have created three websites of my own within 6 months and I try to make them unique in their own way.</p>
    <p><strong>Try Something New Every time.</strong></p>
    <p>There may be some blogs in the future about front-end frameworks, I am still learning them. So, it’s gonna take some time. But, I can say one thing that they are awesome.</p>
    <p>Another thing, I am not getting paid by Netflix or CodePen or Stack Overflow but, I love to.</p>
    <p><strong>Bye. Au Revoir. Adios. Auf Wiedersehen. Sayōnara.</strong> Those are the only languages I know for " GOODBYE ".</p>
