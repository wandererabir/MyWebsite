    <h1>" Get 3 Lakh+ worth of Developer Tools for FREE "</h1>
    <p>I am not joking about it. I am damn serious about the <strong>&quot;3 Lakh Rupees worth of Developer Tools&quot;</strong>. If you still don't believe then follow this blog and I will make you believe in it. You must be thinking why will someone give away this amount of things for free or who will do this to be more exact.<br>
         <br>
        The one and only who is offering this is <strong>&quot;GitHub&quot;</strong>. Yes, they are giving it for free and if you are a student and at least 13 years old. I am congratulating you for being the lucky guy.<br>
        <br>
        I will let you onto the process of how to get it. The name of the offer is <strong>&quot;GitHub Student Developer Pack&quot;</strong>. GitHub collaborated with 100's companies and organizations to bring the students a way to experience all the best developer tools available in the world and learn from them.<br>
         <br>
        <strong>A fun fact or rather a just fact is that I am not getting sponsored by GitHub. I am doing this solely for you guys.</strong> <br>
         <br>
        The pack includes different categories of tools such as <strong>Cloud Based, Game Development, IoT, Marketing and etc</strong>. Do you want to design some new UI or icons? You will have <strong>Bootstrap Studio, ICONS8, or Canva Pro</strong> on your side. No, no, I think you want to host your website, you will have <strong>free premium domains with an SSL certificate</strong> o your doorstep. Or maybe you want to learn a new language, the pack offers you multiple courses from <strong>DataCamp, educative, Frontend Masters and etc</strong>. If you didn't read all this and just jumped to the process part, I am saying that &quot; I will do the same thing <span>&#x1F609</span> &quot;.<br>
         <br>
        Let's start by seeing if you are eligible for it first :<br>
         <li>Be currently enrolled in a degree or diploma-granting course of studies such as a high school, secondary school, college, university, home school, or similar educational institution.</li>
         <li>Have a verifiable school-issued email address or upload documents that prove your current student status.</li>
         <li>Have a GitHub user account.</li>
         <li>Be at least 13 years old.</li>
         <br>
        By the way, I didn't make these rules. I just copied those from the GitHub page, don't judge because I copied it.<br>
        Let's begin the Ultimate Ultra Super Doper process :<br>
        <strong>Step 1 :</strong><br>
        If you already have a GitHub account, then what are you doing in this step, leave right now and go to Step 2. Now, you don't have an account, so let's make one. You have to create a <a style="text-decoration:none; color:black; font-weight:bold; background-color:yellow;" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> profile with a college mail id or normal email address which we will use to get the Developer Pack later on.<br>
         <br>
        <img style="width:50%; height:auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/materials/a2_4.jpg">
        <br>
        <strong>Step 2 :</strong><br>
        After creating the profile, open up <a style="text-decoration:none; color:black; font-weight:bold; background-color:yellow;" href="https://education.github.com/">GitHub Education</a>. Then, sign in to the page using your GitHub credentials. Go to the <a style="text-decoration:none; color:black; font-weight:bold; background-color:yellow;" href="https://education.github.com/students">Students</a> section where you will find GitHub Student Developer Pack's &quot;See what's in the Pack&quot;. <br>
        After that don't hesitate at all, just explore all the offers and feed your inner <strong>&quot;beast&quot;</strong>.<br>
         <br>
        <img style="width:50%; height:auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/materials/a2_1.jpg">
        <br>
        <strong>Step 3 :</strong><br>
        Let's start with the process again, I hope you calmed your inner &quot;beast&quot;. Click the <strong>&quot; Get your pack &quot;</strong> and get your student benefits. If you already signed in at first you don't need to sign in again. You will be redirected to another page where the important part of the process will happen.<br>
         <br>
        <img style="width:50%; height:auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/materials/a2_2.jpg">
        <br>
        <strong>Step 4 :</strong><br>
        Firstly, you need to select your preferred mail id. Then you need to type in your school or college name and select it from the drop-down.<br>
         <br>
        In the <strong>&quot;How do you plan to use GitHub?&quot;</strong> part, you have to write a few words about how do you plan to use the pack and whatsoever. You don't need to write an essay, just make sure to write something relevant at least in this area.<br>
         <br>
        Put your finger on that mouse and click <strong>&quot;Continue&quot;</strong>.<br>
         <br>
        <strong>Some magic is happening now. Sorry, I almost forgot there is another step - my bad. Let stop the magic for now.</strong><br>
         <br>
        <strong>Step 5 :</strong><br>
         <br>
        <strong>&quot;Upload proof of your academic status&quot;</strong> page has come to uphold justice against those who were impersonating as if they were students. <strong>&quot;Heeheeehaahaa&quot;- My Evil Laughter</strong>. Sorry again, I got carried away with my character.<br>
         <br>
        Now, you just have to provide some documents such as college id or document where the session of your academic period is written or with a date that demonstrates your current enrollment such as -<br>
         <br>
        1. Dated school ID<br>
        2. Dated enrollment letter on school letterhead<br>
        3. Dated class schedule for the semester<br>
        4. Dated syllabus for a class<br>
        5. Dated receipt from the bursar<br>
        6. Dated scholarship/financial aid letter<br>
        7. Other (Example: Screenshot of school portal)<br>
         <br>
        Upload that piece of document and you are done with your part. Now, click that green stupid button that says <strong>&quot; Process my application&quot;</strong>.<br>
         <br>
        <img style="width:50%; height:auto; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/materials/a2_3.jpg">
        <br>
        <strong>Step Finale :</strong><br>
         <br>
        Here, the magic will happen but it will take some time.<br>
        It's not a step, just a reminder that the waiting period can be frustrating. The waiting period can be anywhere between 15 days to 2 months. I don't know what it depends on. <br>
         <br>
        After getting approved, try to use every single offer you get in the pack and learn new things through it. The offers in the pack have it's own time period or limit and until you sign in to those websites, the offer doesn't start.<br>
         <br>
        <strong> <br>
        I am still here at the bottom now with you. So, if you found this blog useful, do share it with your friends, and don't be selfish. A little competition doesn't hurt.<br>
        Bye. Au Revoir. Adios. Auf Wiedersehen. Sayōnara.</p></strong>
